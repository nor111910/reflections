When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when sharing with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    working on something that needs to be separate

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks are github clones
    clones are copies from remote to local
    branches are breaks from the main branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    while working before a commit or push, I could check the activity
    to see where conflicts or issues may happen.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    with out git or githup i might use email or post on share drives...
    git would be easier than email. emails would build up and could become long 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    if I was working on a feature and did not want to break the master
    that others were working from.
    master: good if only one working copy is needed
    branch: keep out of master until feature is working
