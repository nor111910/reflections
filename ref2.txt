------------------------------------------------
WN5741 reflections $ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Public/documents/Training/FrontEndDeveloper/GIT/reflections/.git/
WN5741 (master #) reflections $ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        ref.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
------------------------------------------------

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
